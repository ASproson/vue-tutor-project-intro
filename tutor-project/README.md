# Vue3 + Vite + Vuetify Project

Hi everyone, welcome to the Vue demo project. The goal of this exercise is to generate a single page web app using Vue with Vuetify. In this project you'll be launching a local server, creating components, rendering those components, and edting a graph I created in advance. A lot of the boiler plate code has been created for you so that you can focus on learning Vue. Below are step-by-step instructions for you to follow. Additionally, if you run the command `git checkout solution` you'll see the final product and be able to compare your code as needed!

1. Fork Project ✅
2. Clone Project ✅
3. Install packages and run server ✅

Now that the project is setup, it's time to start using and working with Vue
